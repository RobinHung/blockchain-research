# Notes on Atomic Swaps

## Scenario

### Scenario1

* Alice has 5 ETH, but she prefers 1 BTC.
* Bob has 1 BTC, but he prefers 5 ETH.

Therefore, Alice and Bob decide to make a trade. Alice is going to exchange her 5 ETH with Bob's 1 BTC. However, Alice and Bob want to make this exchange **without any trusted third party**, either the centralized or decentralized exchange. Moreover, Alice and Bob don't trust each other. So neither Alice nor Bob is willing to give their property to the counterparty first, and waiting for the counterparty to pay the corresponding amount of money back.
